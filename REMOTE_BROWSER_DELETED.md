# Remote Browser Deletion

The standalone remote browser component (both frontend and backend) has been removed from this project as requested.

## Reason for Deletion

The remote browser was originally designed as a separate web application with its own frontend and backend. However, a design decision was made to:

1. Integrate the remote browser functionality directly into the demo component
2. Only show the remote browser when automation tasks are being executed
3. Simplify the overall architecture by removing the standalone application

## Next Steps

The remote browser functionality will be reimplemented directly within the demo component. The new implementation will:

- Only appear when automation tasks are running
- Be more tightly integrated with the demo workflow
- Use shared dependencies with the main application
- Provide a more cohesive user experience

## How to Delete Any Remaining Files

If some files couldn't be deleted due to being locked by running processes:

1. Close any command prompts or terminals that might be running the remote browser
2. Ensure no Node.js processes related to the remote browser are running
3. Run the `delete-remote-browser.bat` script included in the root directory

## Rebuilding the Functionality

The remote browser functionality will be rebuilt directly into the demo component. This work will involve:

1. Adding a browser view component to the demo UI
2. Implementing conditional rendering based on task execution state
3. Migrating the necessary browser control functionality
4. Ensuring proper cleanup of resources when tasks complete
